* Create a database that can store "Name", "Gender", "Age", "Movements/Notes" - which accepts an array of values.
* Create an interactive web page that has a directory of "Name"s that are links.
* When the "Name" is clicked, the DB is queried, and the server returns the page with the all of the information formatted and styled.
* Use Javascript to fetch the served DB query and dynamically append or change the information.
* Include CSS styling that can be dynamically adjusted with Javascript
* Will require event listeners
* PHP Server-side
* MongoDB or MySQL database
* Javascript animations?
* 
* Design requirements:
* A bulleted list of entries with a date format for every entry
* Displays Name, possibly Photo, Gender, Age
* 
* Handling forms:
* -have form entry be dynamically appended by JavaScript.
* -A button 'New Entry' -> alters html, brings up "name", "gender", "age" forms.
* -search form with 'submit' button
* -with retrieved Entry, displaying list of $notes, a button "New Note"
* -"New Note" will be an Event Listener button, that will append a form with a button "Add Note"
* -If successful (Event Listener), div will popup with "Your note was successfully added"
* -When div is closed with 'X' (Event Listener) the new list of notes will appear.
* 
* 1. submit a text field, which causes Javascript to pass the string to the server setNote method
* 2. have the server run the setNote method, return the formatted $note template to Javascript
* 3. have Javascript append the returned value to the UI.

Insert MongoDB:
db.getCollection('coworkerjournal').update(
    {_id:ObjectId('5a7fe017e662dc7ec495262d')},
    {
        $push: {
            'notes': {'date' : 'Sunday, February 11th, 2018 at 9:48pm', 'note' : 'Zoe tested the update method'}
